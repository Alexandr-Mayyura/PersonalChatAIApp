# PersonalChatAIApp 
 
### Discription:
It's a lightweight messenger with chatGPT, just ask a question and get an answer.</br>The framework used here is https://github.com/adamrushy/OpenAISwift
</br>as well as a token from https://platform.openai.com/docs</br>
This is a trial version and not much has been done here,</br>also note that there is no token file, you will have to add it yourself and just enter your token from openai.com
